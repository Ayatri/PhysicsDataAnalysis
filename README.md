# PhysicsDataAnalysis

Collection of notebooks for the analysis of data in large physics experiments, using open datasets and open source software.

Contains exercises and solutions, and is used as a base for the PRA3024 course at the Maastricht Science Programme. 

(For a gradual build-up of complexity, the order 'python intro' - 'astrophysics' - 'gravitational waves' - 'particle physics' - 'machine learning' is adviced.
